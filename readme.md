# Overview

Currently in a research stage looking into how we can create a V1 frontend /
static view of the data that is getting generated by the snowpack analysis.

# start streamlit

`streamlit run src/main.py`

# Docker

## Build Image

`docker image build -t streamlit .`

## Run Image

`docker run --env-file .env -p 8501:8501 streamlit`

then view at localhost:8501
